# Sudoku
This is a Sudoku puzzle solver, implemented using a recursive backtracking algorithm. It was created to practice my Python skills and to learn more about recursive backtracking.

## Instructions

Open the sudoku_main.py file and modify the Sudoku board example to the one you want to solve. Then, run the sudoku_main.py script. Use the character '0' to represent an empty.
