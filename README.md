# Sudoku
This is a Sudoku puzzle solver, implemented using a recursive backtracking algorithm. It was created to practice my Python skills and to learn more about recursive backtracking.

## Instructions

Open the sudoku_main.py file and modify the board example to the one you want to solve. Then, run the sudoku_main.py script. Use the character '0' to represent an empty.

example of a Sudoku board:

board = [
    [7,8,0,4,0,0,0,0,0],
    [6,0,0,0,7,5,0,0,9],
    [0,0,0,6,0,1,0,7,8],
    [0,0,7,0,4,0,2,6,0],
    [0,0,1,0,5,0,9,3,0],
    [9,0,4,0,6,0,0,0,5],
    [0,7,0,3,0,0,0,1,2],
    [1,2,0,0,0,7,4,0,0],
    [0,4,9,2,0,6,0,0,7]
]
